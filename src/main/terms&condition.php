                <h4>How To Use Our Service</h4>
                <p>Making an Online Booking is easy. Just click on 'Hotel & Resercation' tab at the top of the page, then click the button 'Book Reservation'. Make sure that you entered in your active e-mail address, and complete our reservation form. All bookings will be processed within 5 working days (not including Saturday, Sunday & Public Holidays) from when we receive your request. Please make sure that all the booking details are correct to avoid problems during check-in. An important point is that the name you write on the reservation form must be identical with the ones given in the travel passports.</p>
                
                <h4>Children's Rates</h4>
                <p>We do not have any special rates for children. Sometimes, if space allows, we can offer special requests to have children under the age of 12 stay in the same room as their parents at a small additional charge. An additional bed is then provided. Cots can be provided for children under the age of 2.</p>

                <h4>Confirmation</h4>
                <p>After you have successfully placed a reservation, we will confirm your reservation by sending you a hotel voucher via email. Please print this voucher out and show it to the receptionist when you check-in. Please note that, even when a reservation has been confirmed, there are rare occasions when the requested type of room is not available. In this case, if it is possible, we shall reserve an alternate type of room at a different price.</p>
