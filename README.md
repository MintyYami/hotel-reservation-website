## About The Project

<img src="images/title_page.png" alt="Website Homepage" width=70%>

This project is a full-stack website developed for a hotel client to produce an updated, GUI friendly interface for guests, including a new booking system for the hotel.

The main goals of this project are:
1. A remodel of the old hotel's website to design a more clean and updated look.
2. An integrated booking system to allow guests to directly book from the website, instead of emailing for room enquires.
